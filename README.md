# Project Overview: Detection of Phishing Attacks in Big Data Environments Using Sentiment Analysis and Deep Learning Methods
This project focuses on detecting phishing emails by leveraging sentiment analysis and machine learning techniques. Using the Enron Email Dataset, consisting of 50,000 email samples, the workflow includes the following steps:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Detailed inspection and visualization of the dataset to understand patterns and insights.
Sentiment Analysis: Performing sentiment predictions using tools like Vader and NRCLex to classify emotions and sentiments in email content.
Clustering: Utilizing the unsupervised learning method K-Means to group similar emails for pattern recognition.
MLP Model Training: Implementing a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model for phishing email classification, followed by performance evaluation.
The project integrates advanced NLP tools, big data processing with Apache Spark, and deep learning to address phishing detection efficiently. The approach aims to provide robust results for cybersecurity applications.

Key Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, PySpark, NLTK, TensorFlow, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
